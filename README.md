## what is this

fill this in later

## instructions for use

1. If you're not me, fork the repo
2. Clone the repo into a new folder with the name of your project:

   `git clone git@github.com:continentaldivide/ts-node-test.git example-repo-name`

3. Move into the folder and get rid of the git history so you don't inherit my commits from the starter kit:

   ```
   cd example-repo-name
   rm -rf .git
   ```

4. Delete this README so you can add one appropriate for the project:

   `rm README.md`

5. Install dependencies

   `npm i`

6. Re-add git

   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

7. run `npm run dev` and ensure that nodemon launches the server and you can view a response at `localhost:8888`
